Initial Report: Predicting Used Car Prices Using Machine Learning

1. Introduction This report aims to predict the prices of used cars using various machine learning models. Accurate price predictions can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions and assist dealerships in optimizing their pricing strategies.

2. Data Collection and Exploration The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, containing information on used cars, including features like make, model, year, mileage, and price.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) EDA helps in understanding the data distribution, identifying missing values, and detecting outliers. Notebook has code with plots.

4. Data Preprocessing Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.

5. Model Building and Evaluation We will build and evaluate multiple models, including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. We will also use cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. For initial report restricted to linear and LASSO. NN and DTs will be tried in final capstone report.

7. Conclusion The report demonstrates the application of various machine learning models to predict used car prices. More models will be explored in final capstone report
